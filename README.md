# Love Data Week 2024
## Learn Text Analysis with Python: a Case Study with Fredrick Douglass' writings

“Once you learn to read, you will be forever free.” - Frederick Douglass
 
Building upon the Douglass Day Transcribe-a-thon, this workshop asks the logical next question: what do we do with all of this text data? Participants will analyze the previously transcripted works of Frederick Douglass to understand the fundamentals of both python and computational text analysis.
